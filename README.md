Monitors a changing structured value and tells you *how* it changes. This
produces an immutable log of events, modeled as fact assertions and
retractions. This lets you tie mutable data to a system that expects immutable
data. It is useful if you want to query both the current state and the
evolution of that state, a la [Datalog][datalog] in [Datomic][datomic] and
[Datascript][datascript]. It supports arbitrarily nested and structured data
automatically by inspecting its structure, with no code to write. For example,
if you want to monitor a JSON REST API (push or pull) and log changes to a log
processor, `kegan` is for you.
