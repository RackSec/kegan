`kegan` monitors a changing structured value and tells you *how* it changes,
producing an immutable log of events, modeled as fact assertions and
retractions. This lets you tie mutable data to a system that expects immutable
data. That immutable data can go into a log manager, or a database like a la
[Datalog][datalog] like [Datomic][datomic] and [Datascript][datascript] that
lets you query not just the current state, but also the *evolution* of that
state efficiently. It supports arbitrarily nested and structured data
automatically by inspecting its structure, with no code to write.

For example, if you want to monitor a JSON REST API (push or pull) and log
changes to a log processor or dump them into [Datascript][datascript] to see
how it changed, `kegan` is for you.

`kegan` is named after [Kegan][kegan-star-wars], a planet in the Star Wars
universe where citizens' moves are meticulously watched and noted.
